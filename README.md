Week 1 Weekly Challenge for code refactoring

This weeks project we were given a created website to refactor, clean up and bring up to accessibility standards and acceptance criteria.
We were to clean up code, re-arrange the sequential order so that it matches the HTML and makes the CSS easier to follow along.  
Remove rendundant coding and consolidate where possible.  
Adding alt attributes when needed and a concise descriptive title.  
All this ensures the website, ironically made to help with Search Engine Optimization was optimized for search engines.
